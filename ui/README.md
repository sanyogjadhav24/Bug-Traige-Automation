UI (React) â€” quick start

From the `ui` directory (Windows cmd.exe):

1. Install dependencies:

   npm install

2. Start the dev server:

   npm start

Notes:
- The app expects the API at http://127.0.0.1:8000 by default. If your API is at a different host/port, update the axios calls in `src/App.js`.
- If you don't have `react-scripts`, install it via the package.json devDependencies above or run `npx create-react-app`.
